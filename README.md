# Discord-Twitter-Integration

Simple Discord bot with Twitter integration using the twit node package. This is just a foundation of what Twitter integration can look like with Discord using JavaScript. Instead of using direct webhooks you can have tweets posted from a bot account and have more customisation of what is posted.

To use this, just edit the config and env files and then edit the code in the TwitterStream.js to post what you require or leave as default and it will post tweets from accounts listed in the config file.
